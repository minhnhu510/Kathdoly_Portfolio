# Kathdoly Portfolio
## *ABOUT ME*
Thank you for visiting my portfolio. My name is Dang Minh Nhu Nguyen and I go by Kat. I am a graduated San Jose State University student major in Applied Mathematics, concentrated Statistics. I am passionate in building models to identify risks, forcast the future to assist my clients, team, company with the best solutions. 

I love spending my spare with family, friends, cooking, traveling or even enjoying outdoor sunshine.

## *PROJECTS*
### [Predict Transportation Rate on a Spaceship Titanic](https://github.com/minhnhu510/Kat-s-Projects/tree/main/Transportation%20Rate%20Prediction)
* Developed a robust model with accuracy score of 86% to predict the transportation rate of a Spaceship Titanic on Kaggle Data Competition.
* Applied multiple imputation on approximately 10,000 raw data and train 5 different supervised machine learning algorithms to compare the accuracy score.
* Identified the importance factors that impact the transportation rate.
* Methods: Multiple Imputation,  Multiple Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Recursive Feature elimination (RFE).
* Language and packages used: R, MICE, caret, mlbench, MASS, class, randomForest.

### [Analysis of Variance US Health Insurance](https://github.com/minhnhu510/Kat-s-Projects/tree/main/ANOVA%20on%20US%20Health%20Insuarance)
* Identified the affect of smoking status and number of children on insurance price to assist customers' decision, further to aid the provider with correct price range for each cases to minimize risks.
* Methods: Hypothesis test, data cleaning, assumptions checking (i.e. Normality, homogeneity of variances, independence variables), Shapiro-Wilk test, ANOVA, Tukey's Test.
* Language and packages used: R, dplyr, ggpubr, AID.

### [Exploratory Data Analysis Ecuador's Store Sales](https://github.com/minhnhu510/Kat-s-Projects/tree/main/EDA%20Store%20Sales)
* Compared sales and analyzed the relationship between stores in Ecuador to support further predictions based on stores' location and type of products.
* Identified the affect of holidays and oil prices on stores' transactions.
* Cleaned and imputed over 83,000 raw data.
* Methods: Data cleaning, EDA, data visualization.
* Language and packages used: Python, Pandas, fancyImpute, matplotlib, plotly and seaborn.

### [SEIR Model on COVID 19](https://minhnhu510.github.io/Kathdoly_Portfolio/)
* Predict long term behaviors of the SEIR model with added rates to forecast the recovered rate after a susceptible humans get exposed and infectious.
* Built  and compared disease free equilibrium model and endemic equilibrium to prove the assumption that even if 1 person getting exposed but not yet show symptoms, eventually the whole population will have to go through the infectious state.
* Methods: Mathematical modeling, Compartment model, Steady states, Stability checking.
* Language and packages used: R, deSolve, ggplot2, reshape2.

* Unordered sub-list. 
* Methods: 
* Language used: Galaxy Server
