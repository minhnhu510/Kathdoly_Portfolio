## *PROJECTS*
### [Predict Transportation Rate on a Spaceship Titanic](https://github.com/minhnhu510/Kat-s-Projects/tree/main/Transportation%20Rate%20Prediction)
![](/images/your_image.png)
* Developed a robust model with accuracy score of 86% to predict the transportation rate of a Spaceship Titanic on Kaggle Data Competition.
* Applied multiple imputation on approximately 10,000 raw data and 5 different supervised machine learning algorithms to compare the accuracy score.
* Identified the importance factors that impact the transportation rate.
* Methods: Multiple Imputation,  Multiple Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest
* Tool and packages used: R, MICE, caret, mlbench, MASS

### [Analysis of Variance US Health Insuarance](https://github.com/minhnhu510/Kat-s-Projects/tree/main/ANOVA%20on%20US%20Health%20Insuarance)
* Identified the affect of smoking status and number of childrens on insuarance price to assist customers' decision, further to aid the provider with correct price range for each cases to minimize risks.
* Methods: Hypothesis test, data cleaning, assumptions checking (i.e. Normality, homogeneity of variances, independence variables), Shapiro-Wilk test, ANOVA, Tukey's Test.
* Tool and packages used: R, dplyr, ggpubr, AID.

### [Exploratory Data Analysis Ecuador's Store Sales](https://github.com/minhnhu510/Kat-s-Projects/tree/main/EDA%20Store%20Sales)
* Compared sales and analyzed the relationship between stores in Ecuador to support further predictions based on stores' location and type of products.
* Identified the affect of holidays and oil prices on stores' transactions.
* Cleaned and imputed over 83,000 raw data.
* Methods: Data cleaning, EDA, data visualization.
* Tool and packages used: Python, Pandas, fancyImpute, matplotlib, plotly and seaborn.
